  <h1>Welcome to Cute Culture!</h1>
  <p>Cute Culture is your one-stop shop for all things cute! While we mainly focus on fashion, we also offer reviews of various cute products you can find all over the internet. We hope to provide you with information you need to keep your world looking as cute as possible! Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions, recommendations, or sponsorship opportunities!</p>
  
  <h2>What IS Cute Culture?</h2>
  <p>Cute Culture is simple: we like cute things, and we want more cute things in our lives. While this usually relates to fashion, we also review things like home decor, skin care, and makeup! We like to have a variety in our content in order to cover a wider range of products.</p>
  <p>We take a range of things into consideration when reviewing a product, including: price, material quality, shipping times, and more depending on what the product is. For example, makeup will have different things taken into consideration than an article of clothing. We also try to source all products from reputable venues. </p>

 <h3>Disclosure</h3>
<p>In the event that something we review is provided to us, we will always disclose so. A product being provided does not change our stance and will not affect the rating at all. We pride ourselves on being honest and trustworthy with our content. In the event that our opinion of a product changes, we will update the review accordingly. Please note that all opinions are our own and you may have a different experience with the product than we did! </p>
